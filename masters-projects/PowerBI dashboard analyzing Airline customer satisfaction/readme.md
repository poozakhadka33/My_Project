# ✈ Airline Passenger Satisfaction Dashboard

![Dashboard Preview](images/dashboard_screenshot.png)

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction data to understand key factors influencing the customer experience and overall satisfaction levels.  
Using Power BI, we visualized passenger demographics, service ratings, and operational performance metrics (such as delays) to identify trends and patterns that can help airlines improve service quality.

---

## 🧭 Objectives
- Analyze the **distribution of passenger satisfaction** across different demographics and travel types.  
- Evaluate the **impact of service features** (e.g., seat comfort, Wi-Fi, onboard service) on satisfaction levels.  
- Assess how **operational delays** (departure and arrival) correlate with passenger satisfaction.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** to explore key insights and trends.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- 📈 **Power BI** — Data modeling, visualization, and dashboarding.  
- 🧮 **Power Query** — Data transformation and cleaning.  
- 🗂 **Dataset** — Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset (publicly available).  
- 🖼 **Screenshots** — For documentation and GitHub preview.
